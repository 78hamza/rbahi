1. Comparison Charts
Bar Chart: Compare values across categories (e.g., sales by region).

Variants: Horizontal bar chart, stacked bar chart.

Column Chart: Similar to a bar chart but vertical (e.g., monthly revenue).

Bullet Chart: Compare a primary measure (e.g., sales) to a target or benchmark.

2. Trend Analysis
Line Chart: Show trends over time (e.g., stock prices, website traffic).

Area Chart: Highlight trends while showing cumulative totals (e.g., revenue growth).

Sparkline: Miniature line chart embedded in text/tables for quick trend visualization.

3. Distribution Analysis
Histogram: Display frequency distribution of continuous data (e.g., age groups).

Box Plot (Whisker Plot): Visualize data spread, outliers, and quartiles (e.g., salary distribution).

Violin Plot: Combine box plot and kernel density to show distribution shape.

4. Composition Analysis
Pie Chart: Show parts of a whole (e.g., market share by product). Best for ≤5 categories.

Stacked Bar/Column Chart: Compare sub-categories within a total (e.g., sales by product and region).

Treemap: Hierarchical data breakdown using nested rectangles (e.g., budget allocation by department).

5. Relationship/Correlation
Scatter Plot: Explore relationships between two variables (e.g., height vs. weight).

Bubble Chart: Add a third dimension (size) to a scatter plot (e.g., GDP vs. population vs. CO2 emissions).

Heatmap: Show correlation matrices or density (e.g., user activity by hour/day).

6. Geospatial Data
Choropleth Map: Color-coded regions to compare metrics (e.g., election results by state).

Point Map: Plot data points on a geographic map (e.g., store locations).

Flow Map: Show movement between locations (e.g., migration patterns).

7. Hierarchical/Network Data
Sunburst Chart: Multi-level pie chart for hierarchical data (e.g., organizational structure).

Tree Diagram: Show parent-child relationships (e.g., file directory structure).

Sankey Diagram: Visualize flows between stages (e.g., energy distribution, customer journey).

8. Advanced Analytics
Waterfall Chart: Track incremental changes (e.g., profit and loss statements).

Funnel Chart: Analyze stages in a process (e.g., sales conversion rates).

Gantt Chart: Track project timelines and task dependencies.

9. Dashboards & Multi-Variable
Dashboard: Combine multiple charts for an overview (e.g., business KPIs).

Combination Chart: Mix chart types (e.g., line + bar for revenue vs. profit).

Tools to Create These Charts
Common Tools: Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, Power BI, Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), R (ggplot2), Looker.
